# Text Generation using Transformer and RNN

This repository contains a script that implements a text generation model using a combination of a Transformer encoder and an RNN. The model is trained on a given text corpus and can generate text based on a provided start sequence.

## Key Components

1. **Imports and Dependencies**:
   - The script uses libraries like `spaCy` for tokenization, `numpy` for array manipulations, and `torch` for building and training the model.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - The text data is loaded from `input.txt`, cleaned, and tokenized using `spaCy`.
   - Sequences of tokens and their corresponding next words are created and converted to integer IDs.

3. **Model Architecture**:
   - `TransformerRNNModel`: Combines a Transformer encoder with an RNN to process token sequences and predict the next token.
   - The model includes an embedding layer, a Transformer encoder layer, an RNN layer, and a fully connected layer.

4. **Training Setup**:
   - Sequences and labels are converted to PyTorch tensors and loaded into a `DataLoader` for batch processing.
   - The training loop iterates over epochs, updating the model's parameters to minimize the loss.

5. **Text Generation**:
   - `generate_text` function: Generates text by predicting the next token based on the provided start sequence.
   - Uses top-k sampling to control the diversity of the generated text.

## Running the Code

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can use pip to install them:
   ```bash
   pip install spacy torch numpy requests
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
